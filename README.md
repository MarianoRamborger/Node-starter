# A (very small) Node starter.

My small, mostly unopinionated node.js starter for REST apis.
It has basic logging and management of environmental variables, but not much more.

I tried to maximize the freedom to choose any libraries or architecture, while still providing enough structure to quickly kisckstart the development process.
